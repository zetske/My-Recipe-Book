    name: "Homemade Bread",
    dishtype: "Side",
    image: './pictures/photo-bread.jpeg',
    ingredients:
      "1 tablespoon active dry yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 cups warm water not over 110°F, 5 1/2 to 6 cups All-Purpose Flour, cornmeal or flour for dusting, boiling water",
    instructions:
      "In a large bowl mix together the yeast, sugar, salt and water. Let this stand until the yeast is dissolved. Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time to the liquid and mix thoroughly until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface to knead. (This may be a little messy, but don't give up!) Knead It: Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you. Press into the dough with the heels of your hands and push away. After each push, rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this process in a rhythmic, rocking motion for 5 minutes, sprinkling only enough flour on your kneading surface to prevent sticking. Let the dough rest while you scrape out and grease the mixing bowl with a few drops of olive oil (preferred) or non stick baking spray. Knead the dough again for 2 to 3 minutes. Let It Rise: Return the dough to the bowl and turn it over once to grease the top. Cover with a damp towel and keep warm until the dough doubles in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours. Shape it: Punch down the dough with your fist and briefly knead out any air bubbles. Cut the dough in half and shape into two Italian- or French-style loaves. Place the loaves on a cookie sheet generously sprinkled with cornmeal. Let the loaves rest for 5 minutes.",

    name: "Spaghetti",

    ingredients:
      "1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion, 3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon), 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, Pinch crushed red pepper flakes, 1 cup water, broth or dry red wine, 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, Salt and fresh ground black pepper, Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving, 12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape, 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese",
    instructions:
      "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles. Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute. Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions). About 15 minutes before the sauce is finished cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time. Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.",
