    image: './pictures/photo-soup.jpeg',
    ingredients:
      "1 tablespoon olive oil, 8 ounces boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 3 cloves garlic, minced, 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced, 1 onion, diced, 3 carrots, peeled and diced, 2 stalks celery, diced, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 4 cups chicken stock, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 cup half and half, or more, as needed, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves, 1 sprig rosemary",
    instructions:
      "Heat olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper, to taste. Add chicken to the stockpot and cook until golden, about 2-3 minutes; set aside. Melt butter in the stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic, mushrooms, onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in chicken stock, bay leaf and chicken thighs, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 4-5 minutes. Stir in half and half until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. If the soup is too thick, add more half and half as needed until desired consistency is reached. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley and rosemary, if desired.",

    name: "Homemade Bread",
    dishtype: "Side",
    image: './pictures/photo-bread.jpeg',
    ingredients:
      "1 tablespoon active dry yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 cups warm water not over 110°F, 5 1/2 to 6 cups All-Purpose Flour, cornmeal or flour for dusting, boiling water",
    instructions:
      "In a large bowl mix together the yeast, sugar, salt and water. Let this stand until the yeast is dissolved. Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time to the liquid and mix thoroughly until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface to knead. (This may be a little messy, but don't give up!) Knead It: Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you. Press into the dough with the heels of your hands and push away. After each push, rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this process in a rhythmic, rocking motion for 5 minutes, sprinkling only enough flour on your kneading surface to prevent sticking. Let the dough rest while you scrape out and grease the mixing bowl with a few drops of olive oil (preferred) or non stick baking spray. Knead the dough again for 2 to 3 minutes. Let It Rise: Return the dough to the bowl and turn it over once to grease the top. Cover with a damp towel and keep warm until the dough doubles in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours. Shape it: Punch down the dough with your fist and briefly knead out any air bubbles. Cut the dough in half and shape into two Italian- or French-style loaves. Place the loaves on a cookie sheet generously sprinkled with cornmeal. Let the loaves rest for 5 minutes.",
